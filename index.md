# Jagdishwar Mankala
### Introduction:
I am Jagdish, working for SAS Research & Development in Pune. I am currently in Diploma phase of BSc Online degree program. I am very new to Prorgamming and Data Science field and quite excited to learn, collaborate and grow. 
### This is an example Data Science Portfolio

### Education:
- **Bachelor's of Engineering** from Shri Shankacharya College of Engineering & Technology [(SSCET)](https://www.sstc.ac.in/) in Mechanical Engineering Department 
- **Master's of Technology** from Indian Institue of Technology Bombay, Mumbai [(IITB)](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) in Mechanical Engineering Department

### Work Experience:
- Worked at John Deere India (P) Limited as a Lead Structural Analyst for almost 9 years. My primary job responsibility was to do virtual design verification of John Deere Tractor implements mainly Tillage machine [Tillage](https://www.deere.com/en/tillage/)
- Currently working as Analytics Developer at SAS R&D (P) Limited. My primary job responsibility here is to develop analytics software in Retail domain. 

### My Interests:
- I love doing pencil sketching. I also like cooking, hanging around with friends and family.


### Data Analytics and Machine Leaning application in CAE for product design and analysis:
- Development of physics based data driven models using Tillage machine field test data to be used for structural durability analysis. 
- This novel approach involved application of linear and polynomial regression models to build load cases for analysis, further classification models using KNN and Random Forest algorithms are used for deriving acceptance criteria thereby approaching toward an optimized design solution. 


### Anomaly detection using Machine Leaning algorithms for tractors temperature sensor: 
- Development of anomaly detection machine learning program to detect and highlight anomalous data from temperature sensor as part of John Deere hackathon event. 
- This approach used K-Mean, Isolation Forest clustering algorithms for identifying abnormal data and hidden patterns which are published in form of a report.
